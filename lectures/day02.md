% Day 2:  Setting up for Python and IPython
% Raymond Yee 
% January 23, 2014 (<http://is.gd/wwod1402>)

# Goals Today

*  Getting conversation and communication going in class, especially
   in context of 
   [bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091)
* Continue to get us set up for programming in IPython notebook
* Orienting ourselves to _PfDA_, especially the Appendix
* Start in on studying US Census Data

# Import Administrivia: Enrollment and Wait Lists

Official enrollment limit is 49.   I am allowed to have up to 54
students at the upper limit. (As of this morning, there is a total of
59 students.)   So if you are enrolled but don't plan to
stay, please drop the class so it'll be easier to make way for wait
list students.  I will be prioritizing I School students on the wait
list -- as well as people are working actively in the course.

# One Place to Start in Finding Materials in the Course

<http://is.gd/wwod14> (especially the
[README.md](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/README.md))

# Please Talk to Me and to Each Other

We're are a large group of people.  I encourage you to come talk to
me and AJ -- to introduce yourselves to me.  I'm going to work hard to
get to know each of you.  I'd love if you can make sure I know who you
are.  Don't be shy.

You can me Raymond if you'd like.  Let me know if there is a
particular way you want to be addressed.

# We're Using bCourses

The campus has rolled out a new learning management system
([Instructure's Canvas](http://www.instructure.com/).  Our course is
at
[bCourses:  WwOD14](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091).

I want to spend some time to get ourselves oriented in bCourses
because **good, clear communication is important to our work in this
course**.

# Important Features in bCourses

* Make sure you have
  [Notification Preferences](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/profile/communication)
  set properly so that you get notified about the activity on bCourses.
* I will be using
  [Announcements](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/announcements)
  extensively.
* At
  [Assignments](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments),
  you'll find assigments that you need to do on bCourses.
* I hope
  [Discussions](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/discussion_topics)
  will serve many purposes:  for dealing with Q&A--more on the next
  slide; for more informal communication among participants, such as
  [Introduce Yourself If You'd Like](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/discussion_topics/2910401),
* We'll definitely make use of the
  [Gradebook](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/gradebook2).
  My goal is to make it clear as quickly as possible where you stand
  in terms of grades at any time in the course.  It will ease anxiety
  for all of us.  (I don't want us to get obsessed by grades in this
  course...but it's an important device to structure our learning.)
* I think that we'll be able to make good use of
  [Quizzes](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/quizzes):
  to survey the class, to get structured feedback, to assess our state
  of understanding the material, and to evaluate performance.  
* Let's experiment with
  [Chat](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/external_tools/24485).


# Getting Questions Answered

One of the best way to learn is to ask questions and answer
questions.  I hope we can use bCourses Discussions to be a central
place for this to happen.  If you have a question that needs private
attention, by all means, talk to me directly.  But being able to
record and discuss questions openly is a great way to share
knowledge and enable all of us to help each other.

For example: [Any questions so far as we start Day 2?](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/discussion_topics/2910408)

# In Class Activity

Electronic communication will be important -- but we should also make
the best use of the time we have together.

First, let's take some time to reflect on what you personally hope to
learn.  Write some thoughts to yourself.  Then post at least once on
the
[Discussion: What you hope to learn and accomplish in the course?](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/discussion_topics/2907842)
(Due Friday 2014.01.24 11:59pm PST].  (Let's take about 5 minutes to
think and wrestle with find the right place in bCourses).

Then, get into small groups and discuss:
[Small group discussion on what you want to learn](http://bit.ly/wwod1401Q).

# Openly shared class notes

Let's try group note-taking during classes -- it's helpful for me and
you to have a place to capture ideas, questions, action items:

# Continue work on our notebooks

In
[working-open-data-2014/notebooks](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/tree/master/notebooks):

*
  [Day_01_A_World_Population.ipynb](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_01_A_World_Population.ipynb)

* [Day_02_A_US_Census_API.ipynb](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_02_A_US_Census_API.ipynb)

At this moment, I'm not asking you to upload any notebooks....these
are warm-up notebooks to help get you set up to tackle a problem set
next week.  But I will assume that you will have figured out how to
make these notebooks run and that you do know how to do the
exercises.  So look for help if you need it!

This poll might help me to schedule office hours:
