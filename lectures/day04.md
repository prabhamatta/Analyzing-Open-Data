% Day 4:  Numpy & Pandas Intro
% Raymond Yee 
% January 30, 2014 (<http://is.gd/wwod1404>)

# Goals Today

* how to use the _Python for Data Analysis_, textbook for the course
* getting oriented to the basics of `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`

# majot topics in PfDA

* pandas with numpy implicitly
* IPython notebook
* matplotlib
* nice example data sets which we will use (e.g., baby names)

# Work through code in PfDA

A notebook I will talk about: [Day_04_A_PfDA.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_04_A_PfDA.ipynb)

* I will highlight important concepts
* frankly, it took me a lot of trial and error in working through
  pandas, which has a large and complicated structure

one of my favorite tip sheets on Pandas:

# Assignments / Homework

No new items to submit.  But I do expect you to be wrestle with the
materials in the `PfDA`, these notebooks, and talk to others in the
class.

Please, please, please ask questions! :-)
