# Some Context

# <markdowncell>

# The US Census is complex....so it's good, even essential, to have a framing question to guide your explorations so that you don't get distracted or lost.
# 
# I got into thinking of the census in 2002 when I saw a woman I knew in the following SF Chronicle article: 
# 
# [Claremont-Elmwood / Homogeneity in Berkeley? Well, yeah - SFGate](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Claremont-Elmwood-Homogeneity-in-Berkeley-3306778.php)
# 
# I thought at that point it should be easy for regular people to do census calculations....
# 
# In the summer of 2013, I wrote the following note to Greg Wilson about diversity calculations:
# 
# [notes for Greg Wilson about an example Data Science Workflow](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/b3f79cbc-c0c3-48a3-87b6-91da1b939783/1857ddee32d7baa04c55e629da05e0a7)
# 
# There's a whole cottage industry in musing on "diversity" in the USA:
# 
# * [The Most Diverse Cities In The US - Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-diverse-cities-in-the-us-2013-7) -- using 4 categories:  Vallejo.
# 
# * [Most And Least Diverse Cities: Brown University Study Evaluates Diversity In The U.S.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/07/most-least-diverse-cities-brown-university-study_n_1865715.html)

# * [The Top 10 Most Diverse Cities in America](http://www.cnbc.com/id/43066296) -- LA?

# Dependency: to start with -- let's use the Python module: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/census/
# 
#     pip install -U  census

# <markdowncell>

# Things we'd like to be able to do:
# 
# * calculate the population of California.
# * then calculate the population of every geographic entity going down to census block if possible.
# * for a given geographic unit, can we get the racial/ethnic breakdown?

# Figuring out the Census Data is a Big Jigsaw Puzzle

# <markdowncell>

# Some starting points:
#     
#    * [Developers - U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/developers/)
#    * [census/README.rst at master Â· sunlightlabs/census](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/census/blob/master/README.rst)
#     
# 
# We focus first on the API -- and I hope we can come back to processing the bulk data from [Census FTP site](http://www2.census.gov/)

# Prerequisites: Getting and activating key

# <markdowncell>

# * fill out form at http://www.census.gov/developers/tos/key_request.html 
# 
# "Your request for a new API key has been successfully submitted. Please check your email. In a few minutes you should receive a message with instructions on how to activate your new key."
# 
# * click on link you'll get http://api.census.gov/data/KeySignup?validate={key}
# 
# Then create a settings.py in the same directory as this notebook (or somewhere else in your Python path) to hold `settings.CENSUS_KEY`

# <codecell>

import settings

# <codecell>

# This cell should run successfully if you have a string set up to represent your census key

try:
    import settings
    assert type(settings.CENSUS_KEY) == str or type(settings.CENSUS_KEY) == unicode
except Exception as e:

# states module

# <codecell>

# let's figure out a bit about the us module, in particular, us.states
# https://github.com/unitedstates/python-us

from us import states

for (i, state) in enumerate(states.STATES):
    print i, state.name, state.fips

# <markdowncell>

# Questions to ponder: How many states are in the list? Is DC included the states list?  How to access the territories?

# Formulating URL requests by hand

# <markdowncell>

# It's immensely useful to be able to access the census API directly but creating a URL with the proper parameters -- as well as using the `census` package.

# <codecell>

import requests

# <codecell>

# get the total population of all states
url = "http://api.census.gov/data/2010/sf1?key={key}&get=P0010001,NAME&for=state:*".format(key=settings.CENSUS_KEY)

# <codecell>

# note the structure of the response
r = requests.get(url)

# <headingcell level=1>

# Total Population

# <codecell>

# FILL IN
# drop the header record
from itertools import islice
# total population including PR is 312471327



# <codecell>

# FILL IN
# exclude PR:  308745538

# <codecell>

# let's now create a DataFrame from r.json()

df = DataFrame(r.json()[1:], columns=r.json()[0])
df.head()

# <codecell>

# FILL IN
# calculate the total population using df



# <codecell>

# FILL IN -- now calculate the total population excluding Puerto Rico

# Focusing on sf1 +2010 census

# How to map out the geographical hierachy and pull out total population figures?
# 
#  1. Nation
#  1. Regions
#  1. Divisions
#  1. State
#  1. County
#  1. Census Tract
#  1. Block Group
#  1. Census Block
#  
# Questions
#  
# * What identifiers are used for these various geographic entities?  
# * Can we get an enumeration of each of these entities?
# * How to figure out which census tract, block group, census block one is in?
